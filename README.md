# llm-wiki

A Claude Code plugin for building LLM-compiled knowledge bases. Ingest sources, compile interconnected markdown articles, query, lint, research, and generate outputs — all from Claude Code. Optionally view in Obsidian.

Inspired by [Karpathy's LLM wiki concept](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2039805659525644595) and his [idea file](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f).

## Install

```
/install-plugin github:nvk/llm-wiki
```

> **New to a topic? Two commands.** Each topic gets its own wiki — isolated indexes, focused queries, no cross-topic noise:
> ```
> /wiki init nutrition
> /wiki:research "gut microbiome and mental health" --sources 10 --wiki nutrition
> ```
> The research command launches parallel agents to search the web, ingest the best sources, and compile them into interconnected articles. Drill into gaps with more `/wiki:research`, ask questions with `/wiki:query`, drop articles into the inbox anytime.

## Quick Start

```
/wiki init nutrition                              # Create a topic wiki
/wiki:research "gut-brain axis" --wiki nutrition  # 5 parallel agents search, ingest, compile
/wiki:research "probiotics" --deep                # 8 agents, broader angles
/wiki:research "fasting" --retardmax              # 10 agents, max speed, ingest everything
/wiki:query "How does fiber affect mood?"         # Ask the wiki
/wiki:query "compare keto and mediterranean" --deep  # Deep cross-referenced answer
/wiki:ingest https://example.com/article          # Manually ingest a source
/wiki:ingest --inbox                              # Process files dropped in inbox/
/wiki:compile                                     # Compile any unprocessed sources
/wiki:output report --topic gut-brain             # Generate a report
/wiki:output slides --retardmax                   # Ship a rough slide deck NOW
/wiki:lint --fix                                  # Clean up inconsistencies
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/wiki` | Show wiki status, stats, and list all topic wikis |
| `/wiki init <name>` | Create a topic wiki at `~/wiki/topics/<name>/` |
| `/wiki init <name> --local` | Create a project-local wiki at `.wiki/` |
| `/wiki:ingest <source>` | Ingest a URL, file path, or quoted text |
| `/wiki:ingest --inbox` | Process all files in the topic wiki's inbox/ |
| `/wiki:compile` | Compile new sources into wiki articles |
| `/wiki:compile --full` | Recompile everything from scratch |
| `/wiki:query <question>` | Q&A against the wiki (standard depth) |
| `/wiki:query <question> --quick` | Fast answer from indexes only |
| `/wiki:query <question> --deep` | Thorough — reads everything, checks raw + sibling wikis |
| `/wiki:research <topic>` | 5 parallel agents: academic, technical, applied, news, contrarian |
| `/wiki:research <topic> --deep` | 8 agents: adds historical, adjacent, data/stats |
| `/wiki:research <topic> --retardmax` | 10 agents: skip planning, max speed, ingest aggressively |
| `/wiki:search <terms>` | Find content by keyword or tag |
| `/wiki:lint` | Run health checks on the wiki |
| `/wiki:lint --fix` | Auto-fix structural issues |
| `/wiki:lint --deep` | Web-verify facts and suggest improvements |
| `/wiki:output <type>` | Generate: summary, report, study-guide, slides, timeline, glossary, comparison |
| `/wiki:output <type> --retardmax` | Ship it now — rough but comprehensive, iterate later |
| `/wiki:assess <path>` | Assess a repo against wiki research + market. Gap analysis. |
| `/wiki:assess <path> --retardmax` | Wide net — adds adjacent fields and failure analysis |

All commands accept `--wiki <name>` to target a specific topic wiki and `--local` to target the project wiki.

## How It Works

### Architecture

```
~/wiki/                                 # Hub — lightweight, no content
├── wikis.json                          # Registry of all topic wikis
├── _index.md                           # Lists topic wikis with stats
├── log.md                              # Global activity log
└── topics/                             # Each topic is an isolated wiki
    ├── nutrition/                      # Example topic wiki
    │   ├── .obsidian/                  # Obsidian vault config
    │   ├── inbox/                      # Drop zone for this topic
    │   ├── raw/                        # Immutable sources
    │   ├── wiki/                       # Compiled articles
    │   │   ├── concepts/
    │   │   ├── topics/
    │   │   └── references/
    │   ├── output/                     # Generated artifacts
    │   ├── _index.md
    │   ├── config.md
    │   └── log.md
    ├── woodworking/                    # Another topic wiki
    └── ...
```

The hub is just a registry — no content directories, no `.obsidian/`. All content lives in topic sub-wikis with isolated indexes and articles. Queries stay focused. The multi-wiki peek finds overlap across topics when relevant.

### The Flow

1. **Research** a topic — parallel agents search the web, ingest sources, and compile articles in one command
2. **Ingest** additional sources — URLs, files, text, tweets (via Grok MCP), or bulk via inbox
3. **Compile** raw sources into synthesized wiki articles with cross-references and confidence scores
4. **Query** the wiki — quick (indexes), standard (articles), or deep (everything)
5. **Lint** for consistency — broken links, missing indexes, orphan articles
6. **Output** artifacts — summaries, reports, slides — filed back into the wiki

### Key Design

- **One topic, one wiki** — each research area gets its own sub-wiki with isolated indexes. No cross-topic noise.
- **Parallel research agents** — 5 standard, 8 deep, 10 retardmax. Each agent searches from a different angle.
- **`_index.md` navigation** — every directory has an index. Claude reads indexes first, never scans blindly.
- **Articles are synthesized**, not copied — they explain, contextualize, cross-reference.
- **Raw is immutable** — once ingested, sources are never modified.
- **Multi-wiki aware** — queries peek at sibling wiki indexes for overlap.
- **Dual-linking** — both `[[wikilinks]]` (Obsidian) and standard markdown links on every cross-reference. Works everywhere.
- **Confidence scoring** — articles rated high/medium/low based on source quality and corroboration.
- **Structural guardian** — auto-checks wiki integrity after operations, fixes trivial issues silently.
- **Activity log** — `log.md` tracks every operation, append-only, grep-friendly.
- **Zero dependencies** — runs entirely on Claude Code built-in tools.

## Research Modes

| Mode | Flag | Agents | Style |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Standard | *(default)* | 5 | Academic, technical, applied, news, contrarian |
| Deep | `--deep` | 8 | Adds historical, adjacent fields, data/stats |
| Retardmax | `--retardmax` | 10 | Adds rabbit-hole agents. Skip planning, cast widest net, ingest aggressively, compile fast. Lint later. |

Retardmax mode is inspired by [Elisha Long's retardmaxxing philosophy](https://www.retardmaxx.com/) — act first, think later. The antidote to analysis paralysis. Works for both `/wiki:research` and `/wiki:output`.

## Linking: Works Everywhere

Every cross-reference in the wiki uses dual-link format:

```markdown
[[gut-brain-axis|Gut-Brain Axis]] ([Gut-Brain Axis](../concepts/gut-brain-axis.md))
```

The wiki is **not locked into any tool**:

- **Obsidian** reads the `[[wikilink]]` — graph view, backlinks panel, quick-open
- **Claude Code** follows the standard `(relative/path.md)` link
- **GitHub/any markdown viewer** renders the standard link as clickable
- **No viewer at all** — plain markdown, readable in any text editor

## Obsidian Integration

Each topic wiki has its own `.obsidian/` config and can be opened as an independent vault:

```
open ~/wiki/topics/nutrition/     # Open in Obsidian — focused graph for one topic
```

The hub (`~/wiki/`) has no `.obsidian/` to avoid nested vault confusion. If you want a cross-topic view, open `~/wiki/` manually and let Obsidian create its own config.

What works out of the box:

- `.obsidian/` config created on init with sane defaults
- `[[wikilinks]]` power the graph view
- `aliases` in frontmatter enable search by alternate names
- `tags` in frontmatter are natively read
- `inbox/` works as a drop zone in both Obsidian and the CLI

Claude Code is the compiler. Obsidian is an optional viewer.

## Query Depths

| Depth | Flag | What it does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Quick | `--quick` | Reads indexes only. Fastest. For simple lookups. |
| Standard | *(default)* | Reads relevant articles + full-text search. For most questions. |
| Deep | `--deep` | Reads everything, searches raw sources, peeks sibling wikis. For complex questions. |
