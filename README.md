[github.com/nvk/llm-wiki](https://github.com/nvk/llm-wiki)

LLM-compiled knowledge bases for any AI agent. Parallel multi-agent research, thesis-driven investigation, source ingestion, wiki compilation, querying, and artifact generation. Ships as a Claude Code plugin or a portable AGENTS.md for Codex and others. Obsidian-compatible.

## Install

**Claude Code** (native plugin):
```
/install-plugin github:nvk/llm-wiki
```

**OpenAI Codex / Any LLM Agent** (idea file):
```
# Copy AGENTS.md into your agent's context or project root
cp AGENTS.md ~/your-project/AGENTS.md
```

The `AGENTS.md` file contains the complete wiki protocol as a single portable document — works with any LLM agent that can read/write files and search the web.

> **New to a topic? One command, from anywhere:**
> ```
> /wiki:research "gut microbiome" --new-topic --min-time 1h
> ```
> Creates a topic wiki, launches parallel agents, and keeps researching for an hour — drilling into subtopics each round finds. Come back to a fully compiled wiki.

## Quick Start

```
/wiki:research "nutrition" --new-topic            # Create wiki + research in one shot
/wiki:research "gut-brain axis" --wiki nutrition   # Add more research to existing wiki
/wiki:research "fasting" --deep --min-time 2h     # 8 agents, keep going for 2 hours
/wiki:research "keto" --retardmax                 # 10 agents, max speed, ingest everything
/wiki:research "What makes long form articles go viral?" --new-topic  # Question → decompose → playbook
/wiki:thesis "fiber reduces neuroinflammation via SCFAs"  # Thesis-driven: evidence for + against → verdict
/wiki:thesis "cold exposure upregulates BDNF" --min-time 1h  # Deep thesis investigation
/wiki:query "How does fiber affect mood?"         # Ask the wiki
/wiki:query "compare keto and mediterranean" --deep  # Deep cross-referenced answer
/wiki:ingest https://example.com/article          # Manually ingest a source
/wiki:ingest --inbox                              # Process files dropped in inbox/
/wiki:compile                                     # Compile any unprocessed sources
/wiki:output report --topic gut-brain             # Generate a report
/wiki:output slides --retardmax                   # Ship a rough slide deck NOW
/wiki:assess /path/to/my-app --wiki nutrition     # Gap analysis: repo vs wiki vs market
/wiki:lint --fix                                  # Clean up inconsistencies
```

## How It Works

### Architecture

```
~/wiki/                                 # Hub — lightweight, no content
├── wikis.json                          # Registry of all topic wikis
├── _index.md                           # Lists topic wikis with stats
├── log.md                              # Global activity log
└── topics/                             # Each topic is an isolated wiki
    ├── nutrition/                      # Example topic wiki
    │   ├── .obsidian/                  # Obsidian vault config
    │   ├── inbox/                      # Drop zone for this topic
    │   ├── raw/                        # Immutable sources
    │   ├── wiki/                       # Compiled articles
    │   │   ├── concepts/
    │   │   ├── topics/
    │   │   └── references/
    │   ├── output/                     # Generated artifacts
    │   ├── _index.md
    │   ├── config.md
    │   └── log.md
    ├── woodworking/                    # Another topic wiki
    └── ...
```

The hub is just a registry — no content directories, no `.obsidian/`. All content lives in topic sub-wikis with isolated indexes and articles. Queries stay focused. The multi-wiki peek finds overlap across topics when relevant.

### The Flow

1. **Research** a topic — parallel agents search the web, ingest sources, and compile articles in one command
2. **Ingest** additional sources — URLs, files, text, tweets (via Grok MCP), or bulk via inbox
3. **Compile** raw sources into synthesized wiki articles with cross-references and confidence scores
4. **Query** the wiki — quick (indexes), standard (articles), or deep (everything)
5. **Assess** a repo against the wiki — gap analysis: what aligns, what's missing, what the market offers
6. **Lint** for consistency — broken links, missing indexes, orphan articles
7. **Output** artifacts — summaries, reports, slides — filed back into the wiki

### Key Design

- **One topic, one wiki** — each research area gets its own sub-wiki with isolated indexes. No cross-topic noise.
- **Parallel research agents** — 5 standard, 8 deep, 10 retardmax. Each agent searches from a different angle.
- **`_index.md` navigation** — every directory has an index. Claude reads indexes first, never scans blindly.
- **Articles are synthesized**, not copied — they explain, contextualize, cross-reference.
- **Raw is immutable** — once ingested, sources are never modified.
- **Multi-wiki aware** — queries peek at sibling wiki indexes for overlap.
- **Dual-linking** — both `[[wikilinks]]` (Obsidian) and standard markdown links on every cross-reference. Works everywhere.
- **Confidence scoring** — articles rated high/medium/low based on source quality and corroboration.
- **Structural guardian** — auto-checks wiki integrity after operations, fixes trivial issues silently.
- **Activity log** — `log.md` tracks every operation, append-only, grep-friendly.
- **Zero dependencies** — runs entirely on Claude Code built-in tools.

## Research Modes

| Mode | Flag | Agents | Style |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Standard | *(default)* | 5 | Academic, technical, applied, news, contrarian |
| Deep | `--deep` | 8 | Adds historical, adjacent fields, data/stats |
| Retardmax | `--retardmax` | 10 | Adds rabbit-hole agents. Skip planning, cast widest net, ingest aggressively, compile fast. Lint later. |

**Smart input detection** — `/wiki:research` auto-detects whether you're passing a topic or a question:

| Input | Detected as | Behavior |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `"nutrition"` | Topic | Standard research — explore the field |
| `"What makes articles go viral?"` | Question | Decompose into sub-questions → one agent per sub-question → synthesize → generate playbook → suggest theses |

Question mode produces a **playbook** (actionable output artifact) and suggests **testable theses** derived from the findings.

**Modifiers** (combine with any mode):

| Flag | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `--new-topic` | Create a topic wiki from the research topic and start immediately. Works from any directory. |
| `--min-time <duration>` | Keep running research rounds until the time budget is spent (`30m`, `1h`, `2h`, `4h`). Each round drills into gaps the previous round found. |
| `--sources <N>` | Sources per round (default: 5, retardmax: 15) |

```
# The full combo — new topic, 2 hours of deep research, from anywhere
/wiki:research "CRISPR gene therapy" --new-topic --deep --min-time 2h
```

Retardmax mode is inspired by [Elisha Long's retardmaxxing philosophy](https://www.retardmaxx.com/) — act first, think later. The antidote to analysis paralysis. Works for both `/wiki:research` and `/wiki:output`.

## Thesis-Driven Research

Unlike open-ended research, `/wiki:thesis` starts with a specific claim and evaluates it:

```
/wiki:thesis "intermittent fasting reduces neuroinflammation via glymphatic upregulation"
```

**How it works:**
1. Decomposes the thesis into key variables, testable predictions, and falsification criteria
2. Launches parallel agents — but each agent has the thesis as a FILTER. Irrelevant sources get skipped (this prevents bloat)
3. Agents are split: **supporting**, **opposing**, **mechanistic**, **meta/review**, **adjacent** — balanced by design
4. Compiles evidence into wiki articles + a thesis file with evidence tables
5. Delivers a **verdict**: supported / partially supported / contradicted / insufficient evidence / mixed

**Anti-confirmation-bias**: When using `--min-time`, Round 2 automatically focuses harder on the WEAKER side of the evidence. If Round 1 found mostly supporting evidence, Round 2 hunts for counter-evidence.

**The thesis is the bloat filter.** Sources that don't relate to the claim's variables don't get ingested. Higher skip rate = tighter focus.

## Linking: Works Everywhere

Every cross-reference in the wiki uses dual-link format:

```markdown
[[gut-brain-axis|Gut-Brain Axis]] ([Gut-Brain Axis](../concepts/gut-brain-axis.md))
```

The wiki is **not locked into any tool**:

- **Obsidian** reads the `[[wikilink]]` — graph view, backlinks panel, quick-open
- **Claude Code** follows the standard `(relative/path.md)` link
- **GitHub/any markdown viewer** renders the standard link as clickable
- **No viewer at all** — plain markdown, readable in any text editor

## Obsidian Integration

Each topic wiki has its own `.obsidian/` config and can be opened as an independent vault:

```
open ~/wiki/topics/nutrition/     # Open in Obsidian — focused graph for one topic
```

The hub (`~/wiki/`) has no `.obsidian/` to avoid nested vault confusion. If you want a cross-topic view, open `~/wiki/` manually and let Obsidian create its own config.

What works out of the box:

- `.obsidian/` config created on init with sane defaults
- `[[wikilinks]]` power the graph view
- `aliases` in frontmatter enable search by alternate names
- `tags` in frontmatter are natively read
- `inbox/` works as a drop zone in both Obsidian and the CLI

Claude Code is the compiler. Obsidian is an optional viewer.

## Query Depths

| Depth | Flag | What it does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Quick | `--quick` | Reads indexes only. Fastest. For simple lookups. |
| Standard | *(default)* | Reads relevant articles + full-text search. For most questions. |
| Deep | `--deep` | Reads everything, searches raw sources, peeks sibling wikis. For complex questions. |
